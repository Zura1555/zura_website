- Accent color: Terracotta (#B46464). This will complement the olive green, providing warmth and a touch of earthiness to guide the eye to key elements and call to actions.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, imparting sophistication; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Simple, line-based icons for navigation and social media links.
- A clean and modern layout with a focus on readability and easy navigation.
- Subtle fade-in animations for page transitions and content loading.
