# Sanity CMS Migration - Build Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: Missing `@sanity/vision` and `styled-components`
**Solution**: Installed with `npm install @sanity/vision styled-components --legacy-peer-deps`

### 2. Missing Sanity Configuration Files
**Problems**: 
- Missing `src/sanity/env.ts`
- Missing `src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` and schema files
- Missing `src/sanity/structure.ts`
- Missing Sanity utility files

**Solutions Created**:
- ✅ `src/sanity/env.ts` - Environment configuration
- ✅ `src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` - Schema exports
- ✅ `src/sanity/schemaTypes/post.ts` - Blog post schema
- ✅ `src/sanity/schemaTypes/author.ts` - Author (person) schema
- ✅ `src/sanity/schemaTypes/category.ts` - Category schema
- ✅ `src/sanity/schemaTypes/blockContent.ts` - Rich text schema
- ✅ `src/sanity/structure.ts` - Studio structure
- ✅ `src/sanity/lib/client.ts` - Sanity client
- ✅ `src/sanity/lib/image.ts` - Image URL builder

### 3. Next.js Image Configuration
**Problem**: Sanity CDN hostname not allowed for Next.js images
**Solution**: Added `cdn.sanity.io` to `next.config.ts` remotePatterns

## Build Results

### ✅ Successful Build
- **Build Time**: ~12-66 seconds
- **Blog Posts Found**: 2 published posts
- **Static Pages Generated**: 11/11
- **No Build Errors**: All TypeScript and linting issues resolved

### ✅ Generated Pages
- `/blog` - Blog listing page (4.74 kB)
- `/blog/[slug]` - Individual blog posts (6.13 kB)
  - `/blog/0-experience-PO` 
  - `/blog/calculated-field-in-Directus`
- `/studio/[[...tool]]` - Sanity Studio (1.48 MB)

### ✅ Working Features
- Blog post listing from Sanity CMS
- Individual blog post pages with full content
- Author information with images
- Categories and tags
- Sanity Studio interface at `/studio`
- Image optimization with Sanity CDN
- Static site generation (SSG) for blog posts

## Next Steps
1. Access Sanity Studio at `http://localhost:9002/studio`
2. Create and manage blog content through the studio
3. Blog is now fully migrated from Strapi to Sanity CMS
4. Production deployment ready

## Performance Notes
- Blog pages are statically generated for optimal performance
- Images are served through Sanity's optimized CDN
- First Load JS is reasonable at 102-166 kB range
- Studio is properly isolated at 1.48 MB (expected for CMS interface)
